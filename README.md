## Overview

This project aims to predict the closing price of Yes Bank stock for future months based on historical data. The goal is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately forecast the stock's closing price, which can be valuable for investors and traders in making informed decisions.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains historical stock price records of Yes Bank, including information such as date, opening price, highest price, lowest price, and closing price. Key dataset statistics:

- Total records: 8760
- Total columns: 5

## Data Preprocessing

- Removed duplicate records to ensure data integrity.
- Handled missing data, if any, to prevent bias in the analysis.
- Adjusted data types for consistency and accuracy.
- Normalized or scaled numeric features.
- Split the data into training and testing sets.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

In the EDA phase, various aspects of the dataset were explored, including:

- Visualizing data to identify trends and correlations.
- Understanding the distribution of key features.
- Extracting meaningful insights from the data.

## Model Selection

For the stock closing price prediction, a regression model was selected, considering its suitability for forecasting tasks.

## Model Training and Evaluation

- Trained the selected model on the training data.
- Evaluated the model's performance using regression metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2) score.
- Utilized cross-validation to assess the model's generalization performance.

## Hyperparameter Tuning

Fine-tuned the model's hyperparameters to optimize its performance.

## Model Deployment

Deployed the trained model to make predictions for future Yes Bank stock closing prices.

## Challenges

Throughout the project, several challenges were encountered, including:

- Handling duplicate data and ensuring data consistency.
- Addressing initial data type issues to enable accurate analysis.
- Selecting appropriate visualization techniques to effectively represent the data.
- Dealing with missing values to avoid bias in the results.
